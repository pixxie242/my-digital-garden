In 1989, Japan’s Shinkansen bullet train faced a noise problem when exiting tunnels. Engineers redesigned the train using biomimicry, drawing inspiration from three birds:
	1.	Owl: Inspired the pantograph design, reducing noise using serrations and curvature similar to owl feathers.
	2.	Adelie Penguin: Its smooth body inspired the pantograph’s supporting shaft, reducing wind resistance.
	3.	Kingfisher: Its beak shape inspired the train’s nose design, significantly reducing the sonic boom effect.

- Ventilation Systems: Inspired by prairie dog burrows.
- Bacteria-Resistant Surfaces: Mimicking shark skin for hospital use
- Wind Turbine Arrangement: Based on the drag-reducing pattern of fish schools
- Self-Cleaning Surfaces: Inspired by lotus leaves, which use their bumpy structure to let rainwater clean them
- Autonomous Vehicle Movement: Mimicking how ants communicate in ant colony to find food sources efficiently.
- Mercedes-Benz Bionic Car - This concept car’s design was based on the boxfish, resulting in improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency
- Gecko-Inspired Surgical Glue - Researchers created a biodegradable adhesive based on the microscopic structures on gecko feet, useful for closing surgical incisions. Rock climbing shoes or gloves with strong, residue-free adhesives inspired by gecko feet.
- Velcro Fasteners - Inspired by the tiny hooks on burdock plant seeds
- Painless Needles - Medical needles designed to mimic mosquito proboscises for less painful injections.
- Fighter planes from eagle
