## what is it?
- phenomenon of recognizing patterns as ghosts, animals or faces in dark.

## why it happens?
- early humans who could quickly recognize these patterns as threats had higher chances of survival.
- for eg: spotting a bear in the bushes
- in low light, our eyes can only see basic shapes of things and not colors, our brain tries to fill in the gaps and exaggerate it as a threat, because what if?
