all animals are build to reproduce, so they should have reproductive ability as long as possible right. but humans have menopause at around 50. butttt, this is because life expectancy years and years ago was around 50. so humans only have that much egg to reproduce, our bodies haven’t adjusted to the new average lifespan, which is pretty new cz of availability of hospitals and foods etc. also lions and bears won’t kill us anymore at night when we sleep. 
this is the reason humans stop reproduction at around 50.
