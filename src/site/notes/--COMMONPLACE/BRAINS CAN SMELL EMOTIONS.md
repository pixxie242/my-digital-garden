- Humans can smell emotions ( fear, happiness, sexual arousiness, anxiety) from the chemical composition of sweat (chemosignalling).
- for eg- someone is crying and they are sweating, and anoither person is sky diving or something and sweating, our brain can know the differences. but we wont even know.
- people who got exposed to different sweats gets different emotions triggered even without them knowing. this is the reason we can somewhat know how the situation is, when we get into a room of people. If it is a tensed and anxiety inducing environment, our brain can pick that.


- Emotional sweat activates amygdala, enhancing sensory vigilance and emotional arousal without conscious awareness of odor.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7218249/) 
- **Orbitofrontal Cortex**: This region helps integrate olfactory cues with decision-making processes related to social interactions.


Chemosignals from sweat can influence perception and behavior in profound ways:
	•	Fear Sweat: Increases readiness to detect threats and enhances visual discrimination under ambiguous conditions.
	•	Happy Sweat: Promotes positive mood induction and may improve social bonding.
	•	Stress Sweat: Modulates emotional states and task performance by heightening alertness



Applications and Implications
The ability to detect emotions through sweat has wide-ranging implications:
	1.	Therapeutic Uses: Emotional chemosignals could enhance treatments for anxiety disorders or improve mindfulness therapies.
	2.	Wearable Technology: Emerging devices aim to monitor stress biomarkers in sweat for real-time emotion tracking, which could revolutionize affective computing.
	3.	Social Communication: Understanding olfactory cues could deepen insights into non-verbal communication and human interaction dynamic
