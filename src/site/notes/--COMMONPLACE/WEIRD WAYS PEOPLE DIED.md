While death is often a serious and somber subject, there have been some truly bizarre and unusual causes of death throughout history. Here are a few of the **weirdest ways people have died**:

  

**1. Death by Laughter:**

• In 1566, a man named **Erasmus of Rotterdam** reportedly died from **extreme laughter** after watching a joke played on him by a friend. It is said he died from a heart attack or possibly from asphyxiation due to uncontrollable laughter.

• Another well-known case involved **Chrysippus**, an ancient Greek philosopher, who is said to have died from laughing at his donkey eating figs.

  

**2. Death by Escalator:**

• In 2018, a Chinese man was tragically killed when an escalator in a mall **suddenly malfunctioned** and collapsed, trapping him under the **escalator stairs**. Although escalator-related accidents are rare, this incident was particularly unusual.

  

**3. Coconut Death:**

• Falling coconuts are famously said to cause several deaths each year. The statistic suggests that **coconuts** cause more deaths annually than **sharks**. The combination of a heavy coconut falling from a tall palm tree can result in fatal injuries, though it’s very rare.

  

**4. Death by Hiccups:**

• **Charles Osborne**, a man from the U.S., had **hiccups** for 68 years. It was a medical anomaly, and although he survived for many decades, the prolonged hiccups led to complications that eventually contributed to his death. He hiccupped about 40 times per minute for the first few years of his condition!

  

**5. Death by Falling from a Toilet:**

• While it might sound comical, **falling from a toilet** and sustaining a fatal injury is not unheard of. For example, in 2013, a man in **Sweden** was found dead after slipping and falling while using the toilet. He hit his head on a tile and died from head trauma.

  

**6. Death by Paper Cut:**

• Although incredibly rare, some people have died from complications caused by **paper cuts**. **Infection** after a small injury, especially if it introduces harmful bacteria into the bloodstream, can lead to life-threatening conditions like **sepsis**, leading to death in extreme cases.

  

**7. Death by Overuse of the Internet:**

• In 2003, a **Japanese man** was found dead after reportedly playing **video games** for **50 hours straight** without taking breaks for sleep, food, or rest. It is believed that he died from **exhaustion**, dehydration, and **heart failure**.

  

**8. Death by Rolling in a Carpet:**

• **Emiliano Sala**, a footballer, tragically died in a **plane crash** in 2019. A weird aspect of the case was that his body was reportedly **found wrapped up in a carpet** after being recovered. Although this doesn’t reflect a cause of death in itself, it became part of the eerie nature of the incident.

  

**9. Death by Inhalation of Champagne:**

• In 2013, a man in **Germany** died after inhaling **carbon dioxide** from **champagne**. The gas in sparkling wine can be harmful in very high quantities, and inhaling it directly from the bottle led to asphyxiation in this case.

  

**10. Death by Ostrich Kick:**

• In **Australia**, a farmer reportedly died in 2013 after being **kicked by an ostrich**. The bird’s powerful kick caused significant **internal injuries** and proved to be fatal.
