when a woman is pregnant and does take heroin, cocaine or opiate drugs, the baby gets the high too through the blood. and when baby is born, it will start craving for drugs and will show withdrawal symptoms. 
damn. didn’t think of it like that.

makes sense cz the baby’s and mothers blood circulation will be combined when pregnant
