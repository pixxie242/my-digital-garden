## what is it?
- ever felt like jumping off from a high building while you are there, or jump in front of a truck? kind of like an intrusive thought. 
	- this phenomenon is called Call of the void.

## why do we experience it?
- it's like our brain's way of rehearsing possible dangers.
- for eg: if we're standing near a ledge, the brain need you not to think of anything else and be careless, it wants you to think about the ledge while you're at it, so you will be aware of it all the time.
- it is NOT a suicidal thought, it is our brain's way to reassure that we will always choose not to jump, testing out survival instinct.
- it is actually good for us, helps us to be aware and avoid danger.

##### EXTRA
-  The _amygdala_ (which processes fear and emotions) rapidly detects threats, while the _prefrontal cortex_ (which controls rational thought and decision-making) evaluates these threats logically.
- If thereâ€™s a disconnect or delay between these two systems, you might briefly experience an irrational impulse before logic takes over and shuts it down.
