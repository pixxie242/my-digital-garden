### what are they? 
 - patterns formed by sand on a vibrating plate from sound

## how?
  - The plates vibrates at specific frequencies
  - Vibrations create areas that move a lot (antinodes) and areas that don’t move (nodes)
  - Sand moves away from moving areas and collects in still areas

	•	Different frequencies create different patterns
	•	Higher frequencies make more complex patterns
