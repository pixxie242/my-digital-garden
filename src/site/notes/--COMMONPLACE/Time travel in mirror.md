- we're seeing our past self in mirror.
- if mirror is 1 metre away, we're looking into 3 nanoseconds in past. 66.7 ns if 10m. 0.67 micro secs if 100m.
- if it is 1 light year away, we will be looking at ==2 year== in the past.
- ( possible in theory only cz mirror's size will be impossible to achieve-260000km in size)
