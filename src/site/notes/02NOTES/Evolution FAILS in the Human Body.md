Human body got a lot of problems.
So many flaws that goes unnoticed.

# Weaknesses
#### Eyes
 - 1/2 of Americans & europeans and 7/10 of Asians can't see properly.
 - In prehistoric era that meant starvation and death. Bad eyes, empty stomach.
 - Test the **blindspot** ![Pasted image 20250409110646.png](/img/user/z-%20ASSETS/Pasted%20image%2020250409110646.png)
 - The brain fills in the spot.

### Sinuses

 - The mucus from sinus behind cheeks have to drain up to the throat, causing it to get stuck sometimes causing frequent sinus infections.

### Throat
 - Birds and snakes can swallow a their meal as whole without choking. Their nostrils connect without having common throat hole, like and alternate breathing system.
 - But for us mammals we eat and breathe through the same throat hole just separated by a small flap called epiglottis.

### Upright walking
- Human knee and ankles looks like and elementary school art project help together by rubber bands. 
- For our ancestors, they had twice muscles and used arms to carry their weight.

- When you change direction while running, the ACL is the only thing that's holding the legs together. Tear of this is so common.
- Next is the Achilles tendon which holds all the weight of body to the feet.

### Diet
- Most animals can make their own amino acids, vitamins and other nutrients.
- We have to get these in our diet to function properly.
- Almost every animal on earth make their own vitamin C.
- Humans have all the genes needed to make it but somewhere in history we stopped doing it. Maybe because of abundance of food from farming and cooking.


- Most people grow a third set of molars, wisdom teeth, that won't even fit in the mouth and have to be removed.
- Most women can't deliver a baby without medical assistance because the human head is so large.
- Our back hurts because we walk upright with a spine that used to be horizontal.
