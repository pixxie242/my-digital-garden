## 30 page solution
- 30 pages a day
	- 10 pages in the morning
	- 5 pages at lunch
	- 15 pages before bed

## Reading triggers
- Morning coffee should be a trigger
- Lunch time
- Bed

## Environment
- Place books in the places you feel bored or get distracted to act as trigger.
- 20 second rule:
	- 20 second easier to read, 20 seconds to access to distraction
	- Book at the table
	- Phone charged at distant
- Add reading stations. 
	- Different genres/books to each stations.

## Time alchemy
- Waiting time becomes opportunities
- Wait? - Read/Listen to audiobook.

- Read multiple books at a time.
	- one for leisure, chill/productive, learning.

## Retention
- Pause- think about it.
- Ask questions to author, ask yourself.
- Make connections.

## Implementation
- What's the smallest step you can do right now to implement that idea from the book?
- Knowledge without action isn't really knowledge, it's just information waiting to be forgotten.
