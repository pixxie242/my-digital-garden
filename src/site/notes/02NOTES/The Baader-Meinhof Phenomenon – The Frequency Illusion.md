**Why You Suddenly Notice Something Everywhere**

Ever learned a new word and then suddenly started seeing it **everywhere**? Or maybe you heard about a rare car model, and now it’s on every street? That’s called **the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon** (also known as the **Frequency Illusion**).

  

**How It Works:**

1. **Selective Attention:**

• Your brain loves patterns. When you learn something new, it gets _flagged_ as important, so your brain **subconsciously looks for it** in the world around you.

2. **Confirmation Bias:**

• Once you notice something a few times, your brain **reinforces the belief** that it’s appearing more often—even though it’s not actually increasing in frequency.

  

**Why This Is Crazy:**

• The world isn’t changing—you are. Your brain **filters reality** based on what it finds relevant at the moment.

• This is why people think the universe is “sending signs” when really, it’s just your mind **tuning in** to certain details.

• It happens with **numbers, words, songs, even people**—ever had a random person pop into your mind, and suddenly they text you? That’s Baader-Meinhof in action.

  

**Real-World Examples:**

• You start researching a new phone, and suddenly, you see ads for it _everywhere_.

• You learn about a rare disease, and now it feels like **everyone is talking about it**.

• You break up with someone, and suddenly, their name shows up in books, songs, and random conversations.

  

**The Mind-Blowing Takeaway:**

  

Your brain is **constantly shaping your reality** without you realizing it. What you pay attention to **becomes your world**—so if you focus on positive things, you might start “magically” noticing more good in life.

  

Kinda makes you question how much of your life is _real_ and how much is just your **brain’s personal highlight reel**, huh?
