- Globally, slightly more boys are born than girls, with an average sex ratio at birth of about 105 males for every 100 females.
- This ratio is necessary for the equilibrium as males have higher mortality rate than females due to Biological factors ( more susceptible to diseases ), and social factor (more riskier behaviours).
- Women tend to live longer than men.
- The sperm carrying the X or Y chromosome reaches the egg randomly, so there’s about a 50/50 chance of having a boy or girl.
- If one sex (say, males) becomes rare in a population, individuals producing that sex gain an advantage because their offspring will have better chances to find mates. Over time, this pushes the balance back to near 50/50.
