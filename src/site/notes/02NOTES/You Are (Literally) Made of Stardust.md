**Yes, Every Atom in Your Body Came from an Exploding Star**

  

**How?**

1. **The Early Universe** only had **hydrogen and helium**—the lightest elements.

2. **Stars Are Element Factories**

• Inside stars, nuclear fusion turns hydrogen into heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron.

3. **Supernova Explosions Spread These Elements**

• When massive stars explode in supernovae, they scatter these newly created elements across the universe.

• The **iron in your blood**, the **calcium in your bones**, and the **carbon in your DNA** were all **forged inside ancient stars**.

4. **Our Solar System Formed From This Star Dust**

• About 4.5 billion years ago, our Sun and planets formed from a giant cloud of dust and gas—**leftovers from dead stars**.

• Eventually, that material became Earth—and YOU.

  

**The Craziest Part?**

• The **gold in your jewelry** came from a **neutron star collision**, not just a regular star explosion.

• Every **breath you take** contains atoms that have cycled through billions of living things over time.

• Some of the atoms in your body **are older than the Sun itself**—over **13 billion years old**!

  

**So What Does This Mean?**

• When you look at the night sky, you’re **literally looking at your origins**.

• The universe isn’t separate from you—**you ARE the universe, experiencing itself.** 

  

Carl Sagan said it best: **“We are made of star stuff.”**
